## Overview

Responsive landing page developed for an insurance website, designed to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. Various elements feature multiple background images, each strategically positioned and sized to enhance the overall aesthetic and structure of the page. I adjusted these backgrounds to achieve a balanced and attractive layout. The navigation bar is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, with two distinct versions: a full-width navigation for desktops and a compact, collapsible menu for mobile devices. The mobile menu functionality is managed through JavaScript, allowing users to toggle it with ease. This project was built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on any external frameworks or libraries.

## My process

I initially developed the website fully for the desktop version, focusing on meeting all design requirements and ensuring each element was properly placed and styled. Once the desktop layout was complete, I adapted the website for mobile devices using CSS media queries, adjusting layouts and scaling elements as needed for smaller screens. After setting up the responsive design, I implemented JavaScript functionality to control the mobile navigation menu, allowing users to toggle it on and off with ease.
